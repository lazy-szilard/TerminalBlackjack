# Blackjack Game for Windows Terminal using Python

This is a simple 1-player Blackjack game created using Python and designed to run in the Windows Terminal. The game was created by me as my 2nd milestone python-project for Pierian Data Complete Python3 Bootcamp to improve my understanding of classes/objects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this program, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python 3 from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

### Installing

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open your Windows Terminal and navigate to the directory where the repository is located.
3. Type the following command to start the game: `python3 main.py`

## How to Play

1. When you run the game, you'll be prompted to enter your name & Chips worth. Press enter to continue.
2. You'll then be dealt two cards, and the dealer will be dealt one card face up.
3. The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over.
4. You can choose to "hit" and receive another card, or "stand" and keep your current cards.
5. If you go over 21 points, you "bust" and lose the game.
6. Once you're satisfied with your hand, the dealer will reveal their face-down card and draw additional cards as necessary to reach a total of 17 points or more.
7. If the dealer goes over 21 points, you win the game.
8. If the dealer has a higher point total than you without going over 21, you lose the game.
9. If you and the dealer have the same point total, the game ends in a tie.
